NAME = "unduplify item"
CATEGORIES = ["items"]
USAGE = "unduplify item <item>"
DESCRIPTION = """Unduplify the item with ID <item>, so that only one user may be holding it.

This undoes duplifying an item via the `duplify item` command.
You must own the item and it must be in your inventory in order to unduplify it.
All copies of the item in other users' inventories will disappear.

Ex. `duplify item 4`"""
